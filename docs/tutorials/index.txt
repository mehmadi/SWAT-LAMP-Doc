Tutorials
=========

The tutorials are based around performing tasks, like adding data or publishing maps. The tutorials are written in a workshop like format and are broken into three groups *Users*, *Administrators* and *Developers*.

.. hint:: An Ubuntu 14.04 based Virtual Machine, containing the base packages and data for the execution of the workshop exercises, is available for download `here <https://www.dropbox.com/s/sucj3pb36qqhav3/SWAT-LAMP%20-%20Training%20-%20v1.4.zip?dl=0>`_
    The Virtual Machine can be launched through `VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`_ or `VMWare Player <http://www.vmware.com/>`_ binaries.
    
    The users to be used with the Virtual Machine are:
    
    .. code-block:: yaml
    
        geo/geo # principal user whith suoders privileges
        SWAT-LAMP/geo # /home/SWAT-LAMP is the location where you can find sources, binaries and training data
        postgres/postgres # system user for the management of the DBMS
