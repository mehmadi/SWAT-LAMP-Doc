A Tour Of SWAT-LAMP
=================
In order to get started, letâ€™s look at the SWAT-LAMP interface and get a feel for how to navigate around it.

The SWAT-LAMP web interface is the primary method of interacting with SWAT-LAMP as a user. 
From this interface, one can view and modify existing spatial layers and maps, as well as find information on other SWAT-LAMP users.

Without being logged in, you are limited to read-only access of public layers.

#. Navigate to your SWAT-LAMP instance (online demo available `here <http://demo.SWAT-LAMP.org/>`_):

    *Welcome page*

    This page shows a variety of information about the current SWAT-LAMP instance. 
    At the top of the page is a toolbar showing quick links to view `layers <http://docs.SWAT-LAMP.org/en/latest/tutorials/users/layers/index.html#layers>`_, 
    `maps <http://docs.SWAT-LAMP.org/en/latest/tutorials/users/maps/index.html#maps>`_, documents (metadata), 
    `people <http://docs.SWAT-LAMP.org/en/latest/tutorials/users/accounts/index.html#accounts>`_, and a search field. Below this is a listing of recently updated layers, 
    including abstract, owner, rating, and download button (if available).

#. Click Explore button and choose Preview. Table data could be visualized as: Grid, Graph or Map.

    *Explore Layers page*

    This page shows all layers known to SWAT-LAMP, available in either List or Grid viewing. 
    Layers can be sorted by Most Recent, Most Popular, or Most Shared. 
    Also available are a list of categories, with which layers can be connected with.
    
#. Find a layer and click on its name.

    *Viewing a layer*

#. A layer viewing page will display, with the layer itself superimposed on a hosted base layer (in this case `MapQuest OpenStreetMap <http://open.mapquest.com/>`_). Explore this page, noting the various options available to you.

#. Now click the Maps link in the tool bar to go to the Explore Maps page.

    *Explore Maps page*

    This page shows all maps known to SWAT-LAMP, available with similar viewing options as with the layers. 
    Currently, there are no maps here, but we will create one later on in the workshop.

    *Search page*

    This page contains a wealth of options for customizing a search for various information on this SWAT-LAMP instance.
    While a simple search box is available at the top of every page, this search form allows for much more fine-tuned searches.

Now that you are familiar with the basic interface, the next step is to create your own account so you manage some SWAT-LAMP resources of your own.
