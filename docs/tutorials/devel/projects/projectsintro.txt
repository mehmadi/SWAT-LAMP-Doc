Introduction to SWAT-LAMP Projects
================================

SWAT-LAMP enables you to set up a complete site simply by installing the packages and adding your data. If you want to create your own project based on SWAT-LAMP, there are a several options available that enable you to customize the look and feel of your SWAT-LAMP site. You can add additional modules that are necessary for your own use case and to integrate your SWAT-LAMP project with other external sites and services.

This module assumes that you have installed a SWAT-LAMP site with the Ubuntu Packages and that you have a working SWAT-LAMP based on that setup. If you want to follow this same methodology on a different platform, you can follow this module and adapt as necessary for your environment.

Overview
--------

SWAT-LAMP is an out-of-the-box, full-featured Spatial Data Infrastructure solution, but many SWAT-LAMP implementations require either customization of the default site or the use of additional modules, whether they be third-party Django Pluggables or modules developed by a SWAT-LAMP implementer.

There are quite a few existing Downstream SWAT-LAMP projects some of which follow the methodology described in this module. You should familiarize yourself with these projects and how and why they extend SWAT-LAMP. You should also carefully think about what customization and additional modules you need for your own SWAT-LAMP-based project and research the options that are available to you. The `Django Packages`_ site is a great place to start looking for existing modules that may meet your needs.

Django template projects
------------------------

SWAT-LAMP follows the Django template projects paradigm introduced in Django 1.4. At a minimum, a Django project consists of a :file:`settings.py` file and a :file:`urls.py` file; Django apps are used to add specific pieces of functionality. The SWAT-LAMP development team has created a template project which contains these required files with all the SWAT-LAMP configuration you need to get up and running with your own SWAT-LAMP project. If you would like learn more about Django projects and apps, you should consult the `Django Documentation`_
