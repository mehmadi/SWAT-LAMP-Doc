Managing maps
=============

The next primary component of SWAT-LAMP is the **map**. Maps are comprised of various layers and their styles. Layers can be both local layers in SWAT-LAMP as well as remote layers either served from other WMS servers or by web service layers such as Google or MapQuest.

SWAT-LAMP maps also contain other information such as map zoom and extent, layer ordering, and style.

In this section, we'll create a map based on the layers uploaded in the previous section, combine them with some existing layers and a remote web service layer, and then share the resulting map for public viewing.
