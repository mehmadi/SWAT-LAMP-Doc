:ref:`accounts_and_users`
    SWAT-LAMP is primarily a *social* platform, and thus a primary component of any SWAT-LAMP instance is the user account. This section will guide you through account registration, updating your account information, and viewing other user accounts.

:ref:`document_types`
    SWAT-LAMP welcome page shows a variety of information about the current SWAT-LAMP instance. At the top of the page is a toolbar showing quick links to document types: layers, maps and documents.

:ref:`searching_docs`
    SWAT-LAMP advanced Search tool.

:ref:`layers`
    Create, delete, manage and share Layers on SWAT-LAMP.

:ref:`styling_layers`
    Beautify the Layer using the SWAT-LAMP Style editor.

:ref:`maps`
    Create, delete, manage and share Maps on SWAT-LAMP.

:ref:`integration`
    Your SWAT-LAMP project is based on core components which are interoperable and as such, it is straightforward for you to integrate with external applications and services. This section will walk you through how to connect to your SWAT-LAMP instance from other applications and how to integrate other services into your SWAT-LAMP project. When complete, you should have a good idea about the possibilities for integration, and have basic knowledge about how to accomplish it. You may find it necessary to dive deeper into how to do more complex integration in order to accomplish your goals, but you should feel comfortable with the basics, and feel confident reaching out to the wider SWAT-LAMP community for help.
