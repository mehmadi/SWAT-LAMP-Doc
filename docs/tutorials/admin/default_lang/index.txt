Changing the Default Language
=============================

SWAT-LAMP's default language is English, but SWAT-LAMP users can change the interface language with the pulldown menu at the top-right of most SWAT-LAMP pages.  Once a user selects a language SWAT-LAMP remembers that language for subsequent pages.

SWAT-LAMP Configuration
=====================

As root edit the SWAT-LAMP config file :file:`/home/SWAT-LAMP/SWAT-LAMP/SWAT-LAMP/settings.py` (or :file:`/etc/SWAT-LAMP/settings.py` if SWAT-LAMP has been installed using **apt-get**) and change ``LANGUAGE_CODE`` to the desired default language.

.. note:: A list of language codes can be found in the global django config file :file:`/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/django/conf/global_settings.py` (or :file:`/var/lib/SWAT-LAMP/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/conf/global_settings.py` if SWAT-LAMP has been installed using **apt-get**).

For example, to make French the default language use::

    LANGUAGE_CODE = 'fr'

Unfortunately  Django overrides this setting, giving the language setting of a user's browser priority.  For example, if ``LANGUAGE_CODE`` is set to French, but the user has configured their operating system for Spanish they may see the Spanish version when they first visit SWAT-LAMP.


Additional Steps
================

If this is not the desired behaviour, and all users should initially see the default ``LANGUAGE_CODE``, regardless of their browser's settings, do the following steps to ensure Django ignores the browser language settings.  (Users can always use the pulldown language menu to change the language at any time.)

As **root** create a new directory within SWAT-LAMP's site packages::

    mkdir /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/setmydefaultlanguage

or::
    mkdir /var/lib/SWAT-LAMP/lib/python2.7/site-packages/setmydefaultlanguage

if SWAT-LAMP has been installed using **apt-get**
    
As root create and edit a new file :file:`/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/setmydefaultlanguage/__init__.py` and add the following lines::

    class ForceDefaultLanguageMiddleware(object):
        """
        Ignore Accept-Language HTTP headers

        This will force the I18N machinery to always choose settings.LANGUAGE_CODE
        as the default initial language, unless another one is set via sessions or cookies

        Should be installed *before* any middleware that checks request.META['HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE'],
        namely django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware
        """
        def process_request(self, request):
            if request.META.has_key('HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE'):
                del request.META['HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE']

At the end of the SWAT-LAMP configuration file :file:`/home/SWAT-LAMP/SWAT-LAMP/SWAT-LAMP/settings.py` (or :file:`/etc/SWAT-LAMP/settings.py` if SWAT-LAMP has been installed using **apt-get**) add the following lines to ensure the above class is executed::

    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES += (
        'setmydefaultlanguage.ForceDefaultLanguageMiddleware',
    )

Restart
=======

Finally restart Apache2 as root with::

    service apache2 restart
