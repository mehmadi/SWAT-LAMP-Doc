Installing SWAT-LAMP
==================

This section will guide you through the steps necessary to install SWAT-LAMP. Basically there are three different ways for you to install SWAT-LAMP. Depending on your purpose, you can choose between those. If you just want to test SWAT-LAMP or just want a completely configured SWAT-LAMP, then try the :ref:`installation`. If you intend to use SWAT-LAMP with some already installed components, then use the :ref:`custom_install` guide. This installation will give you full control over the components and you will be able to configure the components the way you need them. If you instead want to do some development, use the :ref:`install_devmode` guide.
