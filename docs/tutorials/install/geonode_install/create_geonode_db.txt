=================
Create SWAT-LAMP DB
=================

In this section we are going to setup users and databases for SWAT-LAMP in PostgreSQL.

Users and Permissions
=====================

First create the `SWAT-LAMP` user. SWAT-LAMP is going to use this user to access the
database::

    sudo -u postgres createuser -P SWAT-LAMP

You will be prompted asked to set a password for the user. Enter `SWAT-LAMP` as password

Create `SWAT-LAMP` database with owner `SWAT-LAMP`::

    sudo -u postgres createdb -O SWAT-LAMP SWAT-LAMP

And database `SWAT-LAMP_data` with owner `SWAT-LAMP`::

    sudo -u postgres createdb -O SWAT-LAMP SWAT-LAMP_data

Switch to user `postgres` and create PostGIS extension::

    sudo su postgres
    psql -d SWAT-LAMP_data -c 'CREATE EXTENSION postgis;'

Then adjust permissions::

    psql -d SWAT-LAMP_data -c 'GRANT ALL ON geometry_columns TO PUBLIC;'
    psql -d SWAT-LAMP_data -c 'GRANT ALL ON spatial_ref_sys TO PUBLIC;'

And switch back to the 'geo' user::

    exit

Now we are going to change user access policy for local connections in file `pg_hba.conf`::

    sudo gedit /etc/postgresql/9.3/main/pg_hba.conf

Scroll down to the bottom of the document. We only need to edit one line. Change::

    # "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
    local   all             all                                     peer

Into:::

    # "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
    local   all             all                                     trust

.. note::

    If your PostgreSQL database resides on a separate machine, you have to allow
    remote access to the databases in the pg_hba.conf for the `SWAT-LAMP` user and
    tell PostgreSQL to accept non local connections in your `postgresql.conf` file

Then restart `PostgreSQL` to make the change effective:::

    sudo service postgresql restart

PostgreSQL is now ready. To test the configuration try to connect to the `SWAT-LAMP`
database as `SWAT-LAMP`:::

    psql -U SWAT-LAMP SWAT-LAMP
