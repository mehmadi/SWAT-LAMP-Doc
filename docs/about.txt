**SWAT-LAMP**,  is a tool for sustainalbe land management and planing using Soil and Water Assessement Tool (SWAT). 

Scenario management feature built into SWAT-LAMP allow defining scenarios for their impact assessment on both hydrology and water quality. Scenarios are combination of practices that can be represented in SWAT model. 

Scenarios in SWAT-LAMP can be defined manually or by using a built-in Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) tool. This is done based on the effectivess of practices, their associated costs, and importace of the water quality constituents for the user.

SWAT-LAMP is also designed to be a flexible tool. Users can extend and modify practices in the tool to meet requirements in their own applications.

SWAT- LAMP is still in-progress project.

Project Setup
=======================

SWAT-LAMP allows user to use their watershed model developed using ArcSWAT to define a scenario analysis project. As of the current release, only TxtInOut (SWAT text inputs) are fully supported. Support for loading microsoft Access (*.mdb) files is limited; however, we are working to make it possible. The model used to setup the model will be called, baseline hereafter. 


Conservation Practices
==========================

Once the project is setup, user will be able to review and modify a long set of practices already built in the tool. This practices will be used to define scenarios. User can extend the tool by defining new practices based on his/her needs. Implementation cost, Operation & Maintennce (O&M) costs and lifetime of the conseration practices may be defined here.

.. note::

    Defining new practice and modifying existing practices is not active in the Beta release, yet. However, users can work in the source to make their required changes. This will be explained in detail later.
    

Scenario Analysis
===========================

Once the project is setup, SWAT-LAMP lets user to define scenarios manually or by using a decision support tool. User will be able to define scenarios based on the baseline or based on the other scenarios. Each scenario can have different 


Visualization
===========================

After defning scenarios in the SWAT-LAMP user can test impact of practices by running SWAT model. Outputs can be visualized for individual scenario or a group of scenarios for comparison. User can opt to see the graphs for different time steps, ranging from daily to annual.


Convinced! Where to go from here?
